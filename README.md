Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes a dataset containing various medical attributes and implements classification models to provide accurate predictions.


ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction can save lives. In this project, we use machine learning to build a predictive model that can analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of heart disease.

ðŸ§  Algorithms Used
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

ðŸ“Š Dataset
We are using the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, which is publicly available via:

UCI Machine Learning Repository

Or directly through Kaggle if preferred

Features include:
Age

Sex

Chest Pain Type

Resting Blood Pressure

Cholesterol

Fasting Blood Sugar

Rest ECG

Max Heart Rate Achieved

Exercise-Induced Angina

Oldpeak

Slope, Ca, Thal
